# Intro

When you go to a shopping centre, what is your first thought?? You are probably overwhelmed by the number of choices you have as a customer. You may think you are consciously choosing one brand over another…But.... Think again…!!  

What if both the brands you were considering are owned by the same company??

What if your fast thinking brain does not understand pricing manipulation? 

Are you worried that you will be the only person at work without that new iphone??

Let's go through a few ways large corporations have been influencing your decisions. They might impact you but more importantly they are affecting the future generations by robbing them of their planet. 


# First tactics: Marketing or Branding

What would you think a 6 year old will recognise more easily , Mickey Mouse or a cigarette brand. 

If you answered mickey mouse, you were wrong. 

R.J. Reynolds, the tobacco company, started a campaign in 1988 which heavily influenced kids. They came up with a cool camel character called Joe Camel or Old Joe which became so popular that by 1991, 91% of 6 year olds were associating the Old Joe to the cigarette brand. More children were able to recognise Joe Camel than Mickey Mouse from Disney.

This is a chilling testament to the tactics employed by big companies to capture our attention, often at the expense of ethics.

But wait, there is more… You know how Diamonds are forever? 

That is a branding exercise done by De Beers, a south african diamond consortium.

It gives an impression that diamonds are forever and therefore they are expensive. 

In many parts of the world, people spend about 3 months of their salary in buying an engagement ring. This is also an outcome of De-Beers marketing strategy. 

You would think something like a diamond will have great resale value, however they usually lose more than 50% of their value the moment you leave the store. That is probably why diamonds are forever, you will never sell them.

But it is probably the Cigarettes industry that has used marketing the most. Edward Bernays, who is today known as the father of PR, coined the phrase “Torches of Freedom”. He was hired by the American Tobacco Company to recruit women smokers. He decided to eliminate the social taboo. That is precisely what his campaign did, it told the women that the taboo was a sign of oppression and hailed the cigarettes as “Torches of Freedom”. He hired good looking women to smoke in the “Easter Sunday Parade” in NewYork. A popular Feminist of the time, [Ruth Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Hale_(feminist)) also called for women to join in the march saying, "Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!". Bernays hired his own photographers to take good pictures and published them worldwide. This along with other campaigns aimed at women, led to an increase in women smokers. By 1965, 33% of women were smoking in the US. 

A Job well done..!! &lt;Applause sound>


# Psychology and habit-forming

If I asked you how to get kids to come back to your store again and again, what would you say??

You are right… give them free toys. That is what McDonalds did, they started giving free toys with their ‘Happy Meals’. This made them one of the biggest toy distributors. 

On November 2, 2010, the [San Francisco Board of Supervisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors) passed a law which meant companies can only give away **FREE **toys, if their food was healthy. You may think McD improved the nutritional value of their happy meals after this. You are wrong again, they started charging 10c for the toys instead, circumventing the law. 

The adult version of this, the “Active Fit” happy meal introduced in 2004, included a bottle of water, salad, an exercise booklet and a step-o-metre. The amount of effort spent on not fixing the problem is inspiring (sarcastically).


# Price Manipulation

Ever wonder why prices end with .99, it's not a coincidence obviously. It's a psychological trick being played on your fast thinking brain. You usually use the fast thinking brain for trivial everyday decisions, for instance deciding if something is of better value or not. For your fast thinking brain 4.99$ is way cheaper than 5$. This is used in all the industries, your phone probably costs 1599$ and not 1600$, your pen costs 9.99$ and not 10$.


# FOMO factor


### IPhone

Ever felt like you **_have _**to get that iphone or those limited edition sneakers as soon as they’re released? You probably are a victim of artificial scarcity, which induces fear of missing out or FOMO. A lot of companies intentionally create artificial scarcity by calling something “limited-edition” or “colab-edition” and making only 50 to 100 of the product. The value of the product is increased because of it not being available to everyone. Now since the product is so expensive, you don't use it. This makes it a collectible, and once it is a collectible, you have to collect other editions as well. This is a vicious cycle which forces us to buy the latest collectibles everytime they are released.

When a new iphone is released, fans around the globe queue outside their local stores over 2 nights just to be the first in line to get the latest iphone or Apple watch.

An apple user has this to say on their official discussion board.

**_Can you get an iPhone in store on launch day?_**

_Apple Stores are very crowded on Launch Day. You will likely find yourself relegated to a long line of people hoping to get a new phone, who didn't pre-order and there is absolutely no guarantee that you'll get a phone after waiting what could be hours in line. If that sounds like fun, knock yourself out._


This is not just an iphone thing, it happens for other products too. In fact, I can see how someone could be very excited to buy a device that they would probably enjoy for a couple of years. 


### Lune Croissants

The next one beats me, there is a Crossainterie in Melbourne which is reputed to make one of the world’s best croissants. They decided to open a pop-up stall in Sydney in July 2023 for 3 days, to sell a limited number of croissants. On the first day, people started lining up at 5 AM in the Sydney winter, for these croissants. The whole stock was sold out in half a day. I am sure the croissants were really good, but will I wake up at 4 AM just to get to the city to have a croissant? 


### Supreme

If you thought FOMO can happen only during an exclusive event, you are wrong again. Supreme is an American clothing brand, which has ‘weekly drop’ events. They particularly target young men between the age of 14 and 30. They achieve this by creating an illusion of scarcity to drive demand. This shows how well the FOMO works as it can get you to line up every week, despite the mass production of items, and buy limited-edition pieces. Supreme's approach also has a massive resale market, where items are sold at a high markup.


# Lobbying

Another tool in the hands of the large corporations is lobbying. Lobbying, as the name suggests, is the coming together of an industry to influence policy makers to make policies that help them. It gets scary when capital interests are prioritised over public interest. 

In the US, a group supported by the US Department of Agriculture proposed healthier lunches as a way to fight childhood obesity. The food lobbyists sprung into action and blocked the reforms and also had the rules written such that the tomato paste in pizza was considered a vegetable.

We already know that the oil and NRA lobbies are some of the biggest lobbies in the US. They pour billions of dollars in their lobbying efforts. 

Would you believe it if I told you that in the US, the supplements are not regulated as medicine, that means they do not need to be tested like medicine. They get attention only if it causes serious harm to enough people. This is achieved thanks to lobbying efforts from the Nutritional and Dietary supplements lobby. Dr Mike has talked about it quite a bit.


# Conclusion

So does all of this mean that consumers are doomed to keep buying things they don't need? Not really. This is where increased awareness and dialogue play a crucial role. By understanding the tactics corporations use, we can make more informed decisions. 

What happens if your information is also manipulated? Well, it means we need to spend more time researching our choices.

Companies put the onus of research on the public, the public assumes that someone would have done the research. Since it is everybody’s job, that anybody can do, nobody does it. Remember, as consumers, staying informed about our role in the economic system is key.

So, what's your take on this intricate dance between corporations and consumers? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
